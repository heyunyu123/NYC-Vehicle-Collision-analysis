# NYC-Vehicle-Collision-analysis



This is Analytics Framework and Methods course team project with two persons. I retrieved the dataset from Kaggle and collected the external zipcode dataset. As database data is too big, you can find "database.csv" dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/nypd/vehicle-collisions/version/1 

### This project consisted two parts:
#### 1. Part 1
Part 1 is to conduct data preprocessing. we found all data problems in the raw dataset and handled with these problems, such as missing values, wrong data type, typo, etc.
#### 2. Part 2
Part 2 is to analyze cleaned data and model for prediction. We created data visualization via ggplot in R to find the most dangerous time period in each day, week, month, year. Also, we tried to build stepwise regression and time series models to predict the frequency of collisions and the number of vehicles involved in the respective collisions
